# Joel Bond

I'm a software developer currently working at [quin](https://helloquin.com). I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife an two kids.

### Previously

I have over eight years of experience as a developer. I worked on business checking at [Cross River](https://www.crossriver.com). I worked on Roundups and Earn/Found Money at [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com). I did web development for various [other companies](https://read.cv/joeltbond) before that.

In my previous life, I spent most of my time making music, both [alone](https://fortjams.bandcamp.com/) and with other bands. It's been some time since this has been a significant part of by life but I hope to come back around to it before long.

We'll see.
